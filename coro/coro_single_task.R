  p("This demo demonstrates the coro package. It provides the async() function.
    Async() allows cooperative concurrency. You can run multiple async() 
    functions at the same time (so concurrently) and they are all managed by a
    scheduler in the background. Async() is cooperative because it decides
    whether or not it has to await a result. Await() basically suspends async()
    and gives control back to the scheduler. The scheduler constantly
    monitors whether async() operations are ready to make progress or not.
    In the meantime, your Shiny app will just keep running and is not
    unnecessarily waiting âœ¨. If you would run this code synchronously,
    it would have taken at least 6 + 5 = 11 seconds. Now it runs
    two jobs concurrently, getting it down to 6 seconds."),
